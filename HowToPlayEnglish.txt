	-There are 12 separate suits to represent the 12 seasons, each with four cards
	-Cards are matched by the same suit, as specified by the background of the card

	-Each player is dealt eight cards and eight cards in the center; the remaining cards are set in the 
	        middle as the draw pile
Player Turn:
	1. Match card from hand, if possible; otherwise, place one card from hand on table
	2. Flip one card from draw pile and match, if possible; otherwise, place it on the table
	3. Take matched pairs and place it on your side of table
	4. If special combination made, say "stop" or "koi-koi"
Ending the Game:
	-When one player makes a combination, he can either say "stop" or "koi-koi" (come on)
	        -Stop: the round ends and the winner receives the alotted points from that combo
	        -Koi-koi: the player chooses to risk doubling his score if he makes another combo before
		 his/her opponent makes one; if he/she fails, the other player doubles his score for that 
		 round
	-The winner of that round becomes the new dealer
